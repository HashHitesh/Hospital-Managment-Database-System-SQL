# Hospital-Managment-System-SQL
Hospital Management is a term very broad in scope and may be defined from different aspects. It mainly relates to management of all aspects of a hospital , a coordination of all elements of a hospital. This may range from keeping the record of patient details to keeping the record of  inventory of medicines and equipment.

Hospitals interact with a lot of people in a day and there are various activities involved in day to day operations of hospitals, for example booking of appointments, managing doctor schedules, managing patient diagnoses, managing medical supplies etc. The aim of this project is to show how data related to these tasks can be made easier to manage using databases.

The database I have created has 11 tables containing all the tables storing the records of the patients and doctors to all the way up to diagnosis and medical supplies.
